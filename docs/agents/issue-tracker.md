# Issue tracker: GitHub

Issues and PRDs for this repo live as GitHub issues. Use the `gh` CLI for all operations.

## Conventions

- **Create an issue**: `gh issue create --title "..." --body "..."`
- **Read an issue**: `gh issue view <number> --comments`, including labels and relevant comments.
- **List issues**: `gh issue list --state open --json number,title,body,labels,comments` with appropriate `--label` and `--state` filters.
- **Comment on an issue**: `gh issue comment <number> --body "..."`
- **Apply or remove labels**: `gh issue edit <number> --add-label "..."` or `--remove-label "..."`
- **Close an issue**: `gh issue close <number> --comment "..."`

Infer the repository from `git remote -v`; `gh` does this automatically when run inside the clone.

## Pull requests as a triage surface

**PRs as a request surface: no.** _(Set to `yes` if this repo treats external PRs as feature requests; `/triage` reads this flag.)_

When set to `yes`, PRs run through the same labels and states as issues, using the `gh pr` equivalents:

- **Read a PR**: `gh pr view <number> --comments` and `gh pr diff <number>`.
- **List external PRs for triage**: `gh pr list --state open --json number,title,body,labels,author,authorAssociation,comments`, retaining contributor-authored PRs.
- **Comment, label, or close**: use `gh pr comment`, `gh pr edit`, and `gh pr close`.

GitHub shares one number space across issues and PRs. Resolve an ambiguous `#42` with `gh pr view 42`, falling back to `gh issue view 42`.

## When a skill says "publish to the issue tracker"

Create a GitHub issue.

## When a skill says "fetch the relevant ticket"

Run `gh issue view <number> --comments`.

## Wayfinding operations

Used by `/wayfinder`. The **map** is a single issue with **child** issues as tickets.

- **Map**: an issue labelled `wayfinder:map`, holding Notes, Decisions-so-far, and Fog.
- **Child ticket**: an issue linked to the map as a GitHub sub-issue. Where sub-issues are unavailable, add it to a task list in the map and place `Part of #<map>` at the top of the child body. Use a `wayfinder:<type>` label: `research`, `prototype`, `grilling`, or `task`.
- **Blocking**: use GitHub's native issue dependencies. Where unavailable, place `Blocked by: #<n>, #<n>` at the top of the child body.
- **Frontier query**: list the map's open children, excluding assigned tickets and tickets with open blockers. The first ticket in map order wins.
- **Claim**: `gh issue edit <n> --add-assignee @me`; this is the session's first write.
- **Resolve**: comment with the answer, close the ticket, then append a context pointer to the map's Decisions-so-far.
